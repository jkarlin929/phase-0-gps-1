What Git concepts were you struggling with prior to the GPS session?
The differences between Git and GitHub, also had an issue with when to push and pull files and how to save and transfer an image on sublime.
What concepts were clarified during the GPS?
Personal checkin, work approach and driver and navigator. You only merge files on GitHub and not on Git or terminal.
What questions did you ask your pair and the guide?
Where we are from and where are we attending the site portion. We asked Jeff so many questions.
What still confuses you about Git?
When to merge on command line/GitHub. When to push files, and from which branch. When do you merge master/feature_branch.
How was your first experience of pairing in a GPS?
At first I was really nervous because when I did a pairing session the day before. Me and my pair had a hard time doing the Driver and Navigator. But here on GPS we managed to pull it off, work together and switching at Driver and Navigator. I felt more confident after our GPS because me and Jason worked of from our strenghts and weaknesses.
