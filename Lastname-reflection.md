What Git concepts were you struggling with prior to the GPS session?
    -differences between Git and GitHub, when to push and pull files/
    syntax.

What concepts were clarified during the GPS?
    -personal check-in, work approach, driver and navigator, certain Git syntax. Adding/Staging/Committing files makes more sense.

What questions did you ask your pair and the guide?
    - Where we are from and where we are attending the on-site portion.

What still confuses you about Git?
    - When to merge on command line/github and when to push files and from which branch. When to merge master and featured branches.
    
How was your first experience of pairing in a GPS?
    - I felt motivated to get the work done and felt comfortable knowing my knowledge is just where it needs to be. It felt good to hear from my guides mouth how certain concepts work and the breakdown he gave about Git and GitHub.
